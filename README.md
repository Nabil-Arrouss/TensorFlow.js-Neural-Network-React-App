# TensorFlow.js Neural Network React Application

This project demonstrates a simple neural network implemented using TensorFlow.js for performing linear regression (predicting a value based on a given input) all in the browser.

## Overview

The neural network is trained to learn a simple linear function: y = 2x. It takes an input value and predicts the corresponding output.

## React App

The React app enhances the user experience by providing a more dynamic and interactive interface. It includes components for displaying the model training progress, input field, prediction result, and training status.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, simply open the project directory in your terminal, run 'npm install' and then start the React App by running 'npm start'

## Usage

1. Enter the desired number of hidden units, learning rate, and number of epochs.
2. Click on the "Train model" button to train the neural network.
3. Once training is complete, enter an input value in the provided field.
4. Click on the "Predict" button to see the predicted output based on the trained model.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow.js: A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A Javascript runtime environment.
